## Render

- We also attempted to deploy the frontend on Render, but ran into some challenges and weren't able to complete the deployment within the given time frame.
- We'll revisit this once we have more time to work through the process.

## Note:

The frontend team decided to commit to a [single branch](https://github.com/deardreamyy/coding-marathon-2/tree/frontend) rather than creating separate branches for each iteration. 
This decision was made because the refactoring of the hook and page structure was only noted as part of iteration 4, after completing the first iteration with the same structure. 
Given that the initial structure remained mainly unchanged throughout, we found it unnecessary to create different branches for each iteration.
