### Note:

The frontend team decided to commit to a single branch rather than creating separate branches for each iteration. 
This decision was made because the refactoring of the hook and page structure was only noted as part of iteration 4, after completing the first iteration with the same structure. 
Given that the initial structure remained mainly unchanged throughout, we found it unnecessary to create different branches for each iteration.
